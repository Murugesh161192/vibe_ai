- Test coverage could be more comprehensive

### Mitigation
- Manual testing on key user flows
- Monitor error logs after deployment
- Quick rollback plan if issues arise

## ✅ Recommendation

**The code is ready for deployment** with the following conditions:
1. Perform manual testing on mobile devices
2. Monitor initial deployment for any issues
3. Be prepared to address any edge cases that arise

The changes made are primarily UI/UX improvements that enhance the existing functionality without breaking core features.
