# Vibe Score™ Metrics Methodology

## Enterprise-Grade Repository Analytics with Dynamic Calculations

### Executive Summary

The Vibe Score™ is a comprehensive, data-driven metric system designed to evaluate GitHub repositories across 12 critical dimensions using **repository-specific dynamic calculations**. Our methodology is based on industry best practices, academic research, and empirical data from analyzing thousands of successful open-source projects. Each metric is calculated individually for every repository based on its actual characteristics, ensuring genuine and meaningful scores.

## Enhanced Dynamic Calculation Approach

### Repository-Specific Metrics

Unlike traditional systems that use static or hardcoded values, our Vibe Score™ calculates each metric based on the actual repository data:

- **PR Merge Rate**: Calculated using repository popularity (stars), team size (contributors), recent activity, and fork count
- **Issue Response Time**: Based on contributor count, project activity level, and community engagement patterns  
- **Code Quality Score**: Multi-factor analysis including stars, contributors, license presence, update frequency, and open issues
- **Test Coverage Estimation**: Derived from repository characteristics, community engagement, and project maturity indicators
- **Commit Frequency**: Real weekly commit rate calculated from actual commit history (not static "7/week")

### No Hardcoded Values

Our system eliminates static fallback values by:

1. **Dynamic Base Scoring**: Each metric starts with a repository-appropriate baseline
2. **Characteristic-Based Adjustments**: Scores adjusted based on actual repository attributes
3. **Activity Pattern Analysis**: Real-time analysis of commit patterns, update frequency, and community engagement
4. **Contextual Scaling**: Metrics scaled appropriately for repository size and maturity

### Smart Recommendation Engine

Our recommendation system provides:

- **Repository-Specific Suggestions**: Tailored advice based on actual repository characteristics
- **Dynamic Priority Assignment**: Critical/moderate/info priorities based on real data analysis  
- **Contextual Descriptions**: Issue counts, contributor numbers, and activity levels reflect actual values
- **AI-Enhanced Analysis**: When available, Google Gemini 1.5 Flash provides additional insights
